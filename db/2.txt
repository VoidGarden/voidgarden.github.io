<h3>Victims</h3>
<p>Freelancers are always the greatest victims of piracy, an independent game developer may lose over $1000 every year thanks to piracy distribution platforms. Also, small studios and companies like Rovio are enduring such loss because of piracy.</p>
<p>It's a common sense that big companies, like Microsoft, Blizzard and Disney, lose the greatest money because of piracy. They are also victims. But they never sue a large number of piracy hackers, distributors or users, or push anti-piracy laws very positively. Instead, Microsoft almost never paid attention on widespread piracy Windows and Office software in China.</p>
<p>Because the greatest winner of piracy Office series software is Microsoft. By negatively fighting against piracy, its competitors fell down for low incomes, but such loss is affordable for Microsoft. In other words, those companies whose income cannot cover their development budget will be no longer able to publish new versions, yet Microsoft has enough money to waste despite more piracy. Therefore in this market only Microsoft and Apple remained, where neither of them highly depends on these products' benefit.</p>

<p>We are all victims, but big companies ignore piracy and don't care about freelancers and small companies' living. Piracy is evil, and allowing piracy is also evil. They want to kill all of us by ignoring piracy, in which way all creatives have to work for them instead of their competitors, or earn money independently, and they get all money by controlling the entire market.</p>
<p>We simply want to create something fascinating and make the world better and by the way earn our livings, why have we to be enclosed in, or be swept out by, big companies? We simply come up with new ideas and want to push them into reality, why they want to beat us down this way with dirty money?</p>
<p>They hate inspiration and innovation. They hate evolution and revolution. Therefore they can hold the entire market share without fighting against us in unfamiliar domain where no one has experience in advance.</p>
<p>Not only piracy we have to fight against, but also ignoring it. The ones who endure same loss and have strongest power to protect this industry, chose not to protect yet to destroy. Thanks.</p>
